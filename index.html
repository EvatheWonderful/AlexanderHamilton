<h3>Alexander Hamilton was a very important American Revolutionary and Founding Father of the US.</h3>

    <h4>Alexander Hamilton was an American revolutionary, statesman
         and Founding Father of the 
        United States. He was an influential interpreter and promoter of the U.S. Constitution
        , and was the founder of the Federalist Party, the nation's financial system, the United
         States Coast Guard, and the New York Post newspaper. Alexander was born in January 11, 
         1757, in Charlestown. As the first secretary of the U.S. Treasury, Hamilton built a financial
          foundation for the new nation against fierce opposition from archrival Thomas Jefferson. 
          The differences between the two men would help shape the nation's first political parties. 
          Hamilton's polarizing style of politics limited his later career prospects, and in 1804 
          he was killed by Aaron Burr, another longtime political foe, in a duel. His father, the 
          Scottish trader James Hamilton, and mother, Rachel Faucette Lavien, weren't married. While
           studying at King's College in New York (now Columbia University), Hamilton got involved in
            the colonial cause, writing pamphlets like ‚ÄúA Full Vindication of the Measures of Congress,‚Äù
             in which he defended the First Continental Congress's proposal to embargo trade with Britain.
